# Runner Game

This game is made using the LOVE2D (https://love2d.org/) game engine, which
you should install. You can edit files however you want, and launch the game by
simply runnning `path-to-love-executable .` in this directory, but I recommend
that you use the Atom text editor, along with my https://github.com/rameshvarun/love-ide
package, which adds a bunch of useful features.

## About Lua
The main things to know about Lua is that it is 1-indexed, and that variables are
default global unless you use the keyword `local`.
